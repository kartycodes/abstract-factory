# Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory is an experiment to determine whether it is possible to completely automate all development beyond the core domain model and user interface

We aim to show the extent to which the following activities can be minimized or eliminated from a typical SDLC.

- API development
- Database Migrations
- Deployments
- Performance Monitoring
- Performance Optimization
- Metrics Collection

## Running in Development Mode

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

At this point in time, there is no "production" version.
